# Classic Google Search

Classic Google Search is a Firefox extension that removes new Google AI searches and similar features to restore the classic googling experience. 

## How it works

This is a very simple extension that intercepts Google search URLs and appends the `udm=14` parameter.

By adding this parameter, it disables AI search features and search summaries.
